Instructions on How To Build a Twitter Bot to Protest The End of Net Neutrality

## CodePen to My App here: https://codepen.io/thepunkprogrammer/full/YEbxwJ/

As you probably heard, the FCC is planning on ending Net Neutrality as we know it. 

Though there is probably little that can be done to change that, it doens't mean we can't show our resistance.

So this repo contains code for making a Twitter Bot that will show our resistance.

On the server is a websockets connection that sends out a tweet that says: 
"X people and I say 'Fuck Ajit Pai'. Retweet if you do too #netneutrality #FightForFreeInternet https://t.co/KE2wRbq2LC"
every time that a message is sent from the client.

On the client is a simple HTML page that allows people to show their support and force the server to tweet.

It also shows the total people that have so far shown their disent, and one's own personal contribution.

# SO GO AND CLONE THIS REPO 
# LINK YOUR OWN TWITTER
# EXTEND THE FUNCTIONALITY
# LET THEM KNOW HOW WE FEEL

So let's stop feeling sorry for ourselves and actually do something about this.
I'm sure people with much more coding experience and social media presence can really maximize the fuck out of this.

Peace.
